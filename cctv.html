</p>
<p>
     
<h2>Bullet Camera</h2>
<img src="bullet.PNG">
 
Bullet cameras are long and cylindrical in shape and are ideal for outdoor use. Their strengths lie specifically in applications which require long distance viewing. Installed within protective casings, the cameras are shielded against dust, dirt and other natural elements. The cameras can easily be mounted with a mounting bracket, and come fitted with either fixed or varifocal lenses depending on the requirements of its intended application.
Other benefits of bullet cameras include:
 
<li>IR night vision</li>
<li>Compact size aids installation</li>
	<li>High-quality image resolution</li>
</p>
<p>
   <h2> C-mount Camera</h2>
   <img src="c-mount.PNG">
Coming with detachable lenses, C-mount cameras allow for simple lens changes to fit different applications. C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft.
Other benefits of C-mount cameras include:
<li>	Can support changes in technology</li>
<li>	Effective for indoor use</li>
<li>	Bulky size makes them noticeable (which acts as a deterrent)</li>
</p>
<p>
   <h2> Day/Night Camera</h2>
   <img src="day.PNG">
 
Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to function optimally.
Other benefits of day/night cameras include:
<li>	Record in both colour and black & white.</li>
